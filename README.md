## Description 🏀

Basketball is one of the most important and popular sports on an orbital level, either because of the simplicity of its game, because of its massive practice throughout the planet, because of the spectacle that it generates around it or because of the statistical revolution that has brought with him. Although the essence of this beautiful sport, invented more than a century ago by Canadian professor James Naismith, remains, many other aspects of the sport have evolved. Over the years and as professionalism has progressed, the monitoring of the orange ball game has used various factors to increase its level of detail and, consequently, the volume of data analysis. This is how the field of observation within this game has grown exponentially. Currently, statistics are kept in multiple categories and aspects of the sport: points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals, success rates in each type of shot, etc.

The International Basketball Federation, better known as FIBA, is the regulatory body for basketball worldwide, the one that defines the rules of this sport at the international level and the body not only in charge of organizing and coordinating the most important orbital competitions but also of bringing together to all practitioners of this sport at a professional level.

Given the recent avalanche of numbers where any figure from the game is likely to provide a minimally useful message, FIBA has decided to take advantage of this situation and consolidate in an application, the most relevant data of each of the basketball professionals in the planet, so that different queries can be made that allow analysis of these data; that patterns are known about the development of the sport, the criteria that take more force or, in general, where the sport is currently heading.

Therefore, FIBA requested the implementation of a tool for handling large volume of data that allows data to be entered, either in bulk (csv files, for example) or through a graphical interface; delete or modify data; make player queries using the statistical categories included as search criteria (for example, find those players who have scored 10 points per game, or more than 20 rebounds per game). As the first version of the software, FIBA only requested to include the data per player for the following items: name, age, team, and 5 statistical items (points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, steals per game, blocks per game). Likewise, this tool can store millions of data and its speed to obtain these ones, O(log n), reflects the application performance.
